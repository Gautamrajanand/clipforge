fix: Restore original AI Clips behavior - CRITICAL
REVERTED BREAKING CHANGE:
- Restored triggerDetection() call in transcribeProject()
- This is how AI Clips and AI Reframe were working before
- The removal of this call broke AI Clips detection

WHAT WAS BROKEN:
- AI Clips detection was not being triggered after transcription
- Projects stuck in INGESTING status
- Modal showing 100% but not completing

WHAT'S FIXED:
- AI Clips detection now triggers automatically after transcription
- AI Reframe works as before
- AI Subtitles still works (uses job queue from TranscriptionProcessor)

IMPORTANT:
- AI Clips/Reframe use direct triggerDetection() call (original behavior)
- AI Subtitles use job queue via TranscriptionProcessor (new behavior)
- Both flows work correctly now
