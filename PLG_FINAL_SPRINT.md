# 🎯 PLG Final Sprint - Rigorous Execution Plan

**Current Reality**: 5.5/10 (honest assessment)  
**Target**: 9.0/10  
**Gap**: +3.5 points  
**Timeline**: Complete remaining high-impact work

---

## ⚠️ **HONEST CURRENT STATE**

### **What We've Actually Done**:
1. ✅ Homepage messaging (positioning improved)
2. ✅ Comparison page (competitive clarity)
3. ✅ Dashboard section renamed (visual improvement)
4. ✅ Onboarding checklist updated (needs backend validation)
5. ✅ Project card badges (UI polish)

### **What's Missing (High Impact)**:
1. ❌ Analytics tracking (can't measure anything)
2. ❌ Monetization engine (no revenue optimization)
3. ❌ Viral mechanics (no growth loop)
4. ❌ Retention system (no email automation)
5. ❌ Engagement features (no gamification)
6. ❌ Feature gating (no upgrade pressure)
