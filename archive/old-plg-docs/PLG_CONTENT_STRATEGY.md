# 🚀 ClipForge PLG Content Strategy
## Based on Wes Bush's Product-Led Growth Framework

---

## 📊 **Strategic Overview**

### **Core PLG Principles Applied**:
1. ✅ **Time-to-Value < 5 minutes** - Users create first clip in under 5 minutes
2. ✅ **Aha Moment First** - Show value before asking for payment
3. ✅ **Frictionless Onboarding** - 3 steps, no credit card required
4. ✅ **Value-Based Pricing** - Credits align with value delivered
5. ✅ **Viral Loops** - Referral program with mutual benefits
6. ✅ **Usage-Based Expansion** - Natural upgrade path as usage grows

---

## 🎯 **User Journey Mapping**

### **Stage 1: Acquisition (Day 0)**
**Goal**: Get user to sign up

**Tactics**:
- ✅ 7-day free trial with 60 credits
- ✅ No credit card required
- ✅ Social proof on landing page
- ✅ Clear value proposition

**Success Metric**: Sign-up conversion rate > 3%

---

### **Stage 2: Activation (Day 0-1)**
**Goal**: User creates their first viral clip

**Onboarding Flow** (3 steps, < 2 minutes):

#### **Step 1: Welcome & Value Prop** 🎉
```
Title: "Welcome to ClipForge!"
Subtitle: "Turn long videos into viral clips in minutes"
Description: "ClipForge uses AI to find the most engaging moments in your videos 
and transforms them into platform-ready clips for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and 
YouTube Shorts. No editing skills required."
CTA: "Show Me How"
```

**Why This Works**:
- Clear value proposition
- Addresses pain point (time-consuming editing)
- Sets expectations (AI does the work)
- Platform-specific (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube)

#### **Step 2: Quick Win Promise** 📹
```
Title: "Create Your First Clip in 3 Clicks"
Subtitle: "Upload → AI Analyzes → Export"
Description: "Just upload your video and our AI does the heavy lifting. It finds 
the best moments, adds captions, and optimizes for each platform. Your first clip 
takes less than 5 minutes."
CTA: "Upload Video"
```

**Why This Works**:
- Specific time promise (5 minutes)
- Simple 3-step process
- Emphasizes automation
- Reduces perceived effort

#### **Step 3: Risk Reversal** ✨
```
Title: "You Get 60 Free Credits to Start"
Subtitle: "That's 10-15 viral clips on us"
Description: "Each video analysis costs 6-12 credits depending on length. With 60 
credits, you can create multiple clips and see real results before upgrading. No 
credit card required."
CTA: "Start Creating"
```

**Why This Works**:
- Quantifies value (10-15 clips)
- Removes risk (no credit card)
- Shows pricing transparency
- Creates urgency to try

**Success Metric**: Activation rate > 40% (users who create 1+ clip)

---

### **Stage 3: Engagement (Day 1-7)**
**Goal**: User creates 3+ clips and experiences value

**Popup Strategy**:

#### **Popup 1: First Upload Prompt** (After 5 seconds on dashboard)
```
Type: WELCOME
Title: "🚀 Ready to Create Your First Viral Clip?"
Subtitle: "Upload a video and watch the magic happen"
Content: "Our AI will analyze your video and find the most engaging moments 
automatically. Takes less than 5 minutes from upload to export."
CTA: "Upload Video"
Frequency: Once
Priority: 100 (highest)
```

**Trigger**: User on dashboard for 5+ seconds, no projects yet

#### **Popup 2: AI Subtitles Feature** (After first clip created)
```
Type: FEATURE_ANNOUNCEMENT
Title: "✨ New: AI-Powered Subtitles!"
Subtitle: "Boost engagement by 80% with auto-generated captions"
Content: "Our new AI subtitle feature automatically adds perfectly-timed captions 
to your clips. Studies show videos with captions get 80% more engagement. Try it now!"
CTA: "Try AI Subtitles"
Frequency: Once
Priority: 90
```

**Trigger**: User created 1+ clip, hasn't used subtitles yet

#### **Popup 3: Referral Invitation** (After 3rd successful export)
```
Type: CUSTOM
Title: "🎁 Love ClipForge? Get Free Credits!"
Subtitle: "Refer friends and earn 30 credits per signup"
Content: "Share ClipForge with your creator friends and earn 30 credits for each 
person who signs up. They get 20 bonus credits too. Everyone wins!"
CTA: "Get My Referral Link"
Frequency: Weekly
Priority: 70
```

**Trigger**: User exported 3+ clips (success moment!)

**Success Metric**: Weekly Active Users > 60%

---

### **Stage 4: Monetization (Day 3-7)**
**Goal**: Convert free users to paid customers

**Upgrade Nudge Strategy**:

#### **Nudge 1: Low Credits Warning** (< 10 credits remaining)
```
Type: CUSTOM
Title: "⚠️ Running Low on Credits"
Subtitle: "You have less than 10 credits remaining"
Content: "Don't let your creativity stop! Upgrade now to get more credits and keep 
creating viral content. Our STARTER plan gives you 150 credits per month."
CTA: "Upgrade Now"
Frequency: Daily
Priority: 95
```

**Why This Works**:
- Urgency without pressure
- Shows value of continued use
- Clear next step

#### **Nudge 2: Power User Upgrade** (After 5+ clips created)
```
Type: UPGRADE_NUDGE
Title: "🎯 You're Creating Amazing Content!"
Subtitle: "Upgrade to PRO and unlock unlimited clips"
Content: "You've created 5+ clips already! Upgrade to PRO for unlimited AI clips, 
priority processing, and advanced features. Plus, export directly to all platforms."
CTA: "View PRO Plans"
Frequency: Daily
Priority: 80
```

**Why This Works**:
- Celebrates success
- Shows you're a power user
- Unlocks more value

#### **Nudge 3: Trial Ending Soon** (Day 5 of trial)
```
Type: CUSTOM
Title: "⏰ Your Free Trial Ends in 3 Days"

Content: "You've been creating amazing content! Don't lose access to your projects 
and AI tools. Upgrade to STARTER or PRO to continue your creative journey."
CTA: "Choose Your Plan"
